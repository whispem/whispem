## 🌱 Learning Journey

**Rust & Distributed Systems — Since 27 Oct 2025**

Inspired by open source creators who build for clarity, resilience, and performance. 
My current obsession: understanding ownership, lifetimes, and designing systems where simplicity breeds reliability.

**Current focus:**  
- Systems programming in Rust: embracing safety, minimalism, and clear documentation  
- Distributed system principles: learning from elegant architectural solutions  
- Performance, readability, and "less is more" in code  
- Collaboration in environments where knowledge is generously shared

Linguist at heart (IT/EN). 
Tech explorer. 
Design lover.  
My approach: combine creative curiosity with technical precision—whether for mobile apps or distributed systems. 
I believe that the most impactful solutions are both beautiful and robust, and that technical elegance is a form of respect for users and collaborators alike.

Always iterating. 
Always learning. 
Always striving for clean design—in code and in life.

*Fun fact: I see true elegance in both code and design—the kind you recognize instantly because everything feels balanced, polished, and deceptively simple. 
For me, the ultimate goal is to make complexity invisible to the user and beauty an everyday feature.*
