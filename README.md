## 🌱 Currently Learning

**Rust** 🦀 – *Started October 27, 2025 at 00:27 UTC +1*

I'm thrilled to be diving into systems programming! Coming from Swift and mobile development, I'm curious to explore the "other side"—how things work under the hood, memory management, ownership models, and performance-critical code.

The journey from pixels to protocols begins now. 🚀

**Current focus:**
- Rust fundamentals (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)
- Systems programming concepts
- Distributed systems architecture
- Open source contribution

*Goal: Contribute to real-world Rust projects and understand how robust backend systems are built.*

## 🌟 About me
I love exploring cities, learning new languages, and experimenting with interactive tech.  
Curiosity drives me, and I thrive at the intersection of design, code, and creativity.  

I aim to build **clean, beautiful, and playful solutions** that make an impact—from elegant mobile apps to robust backend systems.

Always learning. Always iterating. Always coding.
