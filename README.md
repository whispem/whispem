# Hi, I'm Emilie 👋🏼

**Creative Technologist · Systems-Oriented · Rust Learner**

Curiosity-driven and focused on building things that are clear, minimal, and structurally sound.  
I enjoy turning complex ideas into small, reliable systems or visual explorations where intention matters.

## 🌱 Current Focus  
**Rust & Small-Scale Systems (since Oct 2025)**

Learning by building:  
- ownership & lifetimes  
- small, understandable system components  
- distributed system principles through simple prototypes  
- early open-source contributions (Signal-iOS + tools)

I care about clarity, good documentation, and systems where simplicity is intentional.

## 🔎 About Me

Linguist → technologist.  
Structure-focused, visual thinker, curiosity-driven.

I enjoy combining creative intuition with precise technical reasoning.  
My goal: build things that feel clean, reliable, and intentionally designed.

Always iterating. Always learning.

*I like when complexity disappears behind something balanced, minimal, and deliberate — technical elegance is its own kind of beauty.*
