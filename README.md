# Hi, I'm Emilie 👋🏼

**Curious Technologist · Systems-Oriented · Rust Learner**

I like building small, well-defined systems that make sense — the kind where every piece has a purpose and the whole thing feels clean, lightweight, and intentional.

My background is in languages and structure, so I naturally think in terms of clarity, patterns, and "how things fit together."  
I enjoy friendly collaboration, documenting ideas, and keeping projects welcoming and easy to navigate.

## 🛠️ What I Enjoy Working With

- **Languages:** Rust 🦀 · Swift · SwiftUI  
- **Focus Areas:** small-scale storage systems · data models · predictable state flow  
- **Design Interests:** UI/UX · visual clarity · intuitive representations  
- **Languages I speak:** Italian · English  
- **Background:** Italian studies (Aix-Marseille University)

I like technical work that stays simple, human, and approachable.

## ⭐ Featured Project — mini-kvstore-v2

A from-scratch Rust key–value store built as a learning journey into internal storage mechanics.

**What I'm exploring:**
- Segmented append-only logs with automatic rotation
- In-memory indexing for O(1) lookups
- Safe ownership boundaries and Rust's type system
- Manual compaction (segment merging + space reclamation)
- Small, understandable modules with clear responsibilities
- Per-record checksums and data integrity
- Persistence and crash recovery

The project prioritizes clarity over performance — every design decision is documented and explained.

**Recent milestones:**
- Custom error types with `thiserror`
- Interactive CLI with REPL
- Comprehensive test suite and benchmarks
- Examples demonstrating compaction, persistence, and large datasets

## 🧪 Earlier Iterations & Related Work

### **mini-kvstore (v1)**  
My first attempt at a persistent K/V system.  
It helped me understand where design choices start to break and how to redesign them properly in v2.

### **CSV-Key-Value-Store**  
A lightweight experiment using CSV as a persistence layer — great for understanding abstraction boundaries.

## 🎨 Interactive & Visual Projects

### **DNA Helix Visualization**  
SwiftUI-based 3D DNA structure; a crossover between science, art, and animation.

## 🌱 Current Focus

A mix of systems fundamentals and creativity:

- **Rust learning** — ownership, lifetimes, traits, error handling
- **Log-structured storage models** — segmentation, compaction, indexing
- **Building reliable mini-systems from first principles**
- **Clear documentation & diagrams** — making complexity approachable
- **Early OSS contributions** — Signal-iOS + small tooling

**Next on the roadmap:**
- Background compaction with threading
- Bloom filters for efficient key lookups
- Index snapshots for faster startup
- LSM-tree inspired architecture exploration

My goal is always the same: make things simple, intentional, and pleasant to use.

## 🔎 About Me  

Background in linguistics; mindset oriented toward structure and system behavior.  
I'm interested in small architectures, clear interfaces, and the way simple components can model complex ideas.

I work visually, iteratively, and with a focus on clarity and intentionality.  
My goal is to build tools that are minimal, reliable, and well-documented — systems that make sense.

**Timeline:**
- Started learning Rust: October 27, 2025
- Current project (mini-kvstore-v2): Started November 16, 2025

*"The best way to learn is to build."*

*I appreciate systems that feel balanced — where complexity quietly resolves into something clean, minimal, and genuinely thoughtful.*
